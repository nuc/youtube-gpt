  "-s_ABD7vvM4": "Ladies and gentlemen, did you know that according to my YouTube analytics, 75% of you are between the ages of 18 and 35? No, of course you didn't know that, because if you had access to my YouTube dashboard it would be weird. That means that most of you got into chess or got back into chess at that age. Maybe you played it when you were very young. But did you know there are kids out there who are 3 years old and they are really good at chess? 3! I learned how to move the pieces when I was nearly 6. And in today's video, I'm going to be telling you the story of Mikhail Osipov, a Russian 3 year old chess prodigy who first came to fame like in an explosion because he was on a Russian TV show where they spotlight these types of talents. And in today's video, I'm going to show you clips from the TV show. I'm going to show you the game that he played against world champion Anatoly Karpov. And at the end, we will also look at this little 3 year old dude solving ridiculously hard chess puzzles. And then you can show this to your kids and go, you see how much time you spent on the iPad? You could be Mikhail Osipov. And by the way, there's a second part to all of this, which is the fact that he came back to the show a little while later when he was 4 years old. So I was going to show you the clip, but as it happens, even though it's in Russian, it's fully copyrighted. So instead of showing you the clip, I'm just going to hope that I can click through the clip without actually playing it and setting off copyrights. This is a show called Lutche Vsekh. This is Mikhail Osipov. He is a tiny, tiny human. He is 3 years old. And on this show, they clearly invite guests who are extremely talented at their field of work. And he is so small, he can barely get down a flight of stairs. The show host offers to give him a hand coming down the steps. By the way, if you guys want to watch this video, it's great. It's got English subtitles in case you can't understand. And they sit down and they start having a chat. And he's tiny. His feet, two sets of his legs could not touch the floor. And they talk and he asks him, you know, do you know how the knight moves, which is ironic because Andrea Botes asked that to Magnus Carlsen at the World Chess Championship last time. And then, you know, they talk a little bit and he says he's 3 years old and he likes to play chess. And he asked him a few questions and then they bring out a chess set. That's not his mom, but his mom is in the audience. And they sit down and they're going to play a game with this kind of analog style clock. But here the show host admits that he doesn't know how to play chess and they have a surprise guest and this is like a very famous meme. It's called Chess Final Boss. And basically, the show host invites the 12th World Champion, Anatoly Garpov, you know, sportsman of Russia winning some medal, you know, the Medal of Honor, like, you know, some countries they have like this sports medal. And they bring out Anatoly Garpov. And then this kid's like, what the f- He either was not told or he forgot. And he's looking around. This is like an extremely hilarious meme. And you know, Anatoly Garpov does a little walk out in the tunnel. This is a- I can't play it because they'll copyright it. Hopefully they don't copyright the still images. And then, you know, here Misha says, we studied your chess textbook against Viktor Korchnoi. And he can barely speak. I mean, he can barely say any words. It's adorable. It's completely hilarious. It's so cute. And Garpov like asked him a few questions. And Misha takes the white pieces and they sit down and they play 10 minutes for Misha and two minutes for Garpov. So 10 to 2, not very fair, but you know, one of them is three and the other one's a world former world champion. And you become a world champion for life. It's kind of like being president. You know, they call you President X. Well, you know, world champion Anatoly Garpov. And now I'm going to show you the game and then I'm going to show you a little bit of the epilogue. All right. It was it was incredible. I mean, here's like a still image of them just actively playing, you know, just unbelievable stuff. Anyway, I would have shown you the clip, but they copyrighted it. So instead, I will show you this. Enjoy the game and I will show you the exceptional puzzle solving skills a little bit later. This video is a few years old, obviously. It was filmed in like 20. I don't know. I don't know. My perception of time completely got warped after COVID. I don't know how long ago it was or what year. But he's not the only one. And so what I want to do on this channel is I want to spotlight individual talents like this. So Osipov started the game with the Queen's Pawn. Like OK, Knight f6 from Garpov, c4, e6. This little man is just straight up playing real openings like he's playing the main line Queen's Pawn. He's not even playing a London. He's not even playing like a neutered chess opening like the London. Just kidding. London is great. He's playing principled chess openings. Now Anatoly starts with Knight f6, e6. Rather than putting a pawn in the center, it's actually considered very mildly inaccurate to play this move order of the Queen's Gambit declined. If Knight c3 happens, the reason Black played like this is to fight back against the move e4 with the move Bishop before pinning the Knight to the King. If you know your chess openings, you know this is called the Nimso Indian. If you don't know your chess openings, now you know this is called the Nimso Indian defense. And it's one of the most classical openings in chess. It was something that Karpov played his entire career in the mid 20th century and late 20th century. And here there are a multitude of different lines. There's kind of like the ignore line, which is e3 and finish your development like this or Knight f3. There's other lines though. One of the lines now, I don't necessarily think Mikhail Osipov knows that he's playing main line theory. I think he just saw a Bishop and decided to attack it. But it just like, you know, it so happens in chess. Sometimes you play a random move in the opening and it turns out to be a line. This is called the Samish variation and basically White just says, I don't like your Bishop there, take my Knight. And Black says, no problem, I'm going to take your Knight. Now, why would Black give away a Bishop so early? Well, Black is blocking White's natural development and damaging the structure. So it's going to be a little hard to get this Bishop out, obviously on that side. And you're most likely going to have to play e3. So this Bishop will get stuck. If you play Bishop f4, Black will try to very quickly put some pressure on those doubled pawns. It's good and bad, alright? Both sides have some problems in the position. And Karpov plays c5, which is one of the main lines. Now, White here has an approach to very solidly build up the center. Or this is actually a line that I like to play very much. f3 is kind of like the main line Samish. And the idea is to play e4 just very, very quickly. And in a perfect situation, White gets something that looks kind of like this. And this is really nice. White can then play Bishop, Knight, Castle. And White enjoys a massive advantage of space. But as you can see, according to the eval bar, it's still equal because such is chess. Now c5 proved to be a little bit too enticing for the young man. And he took the pawn. Now taking on c5, believe it or not, I mean as cruel as chess is, is already a borderline losing mistake. Not at his level, and not at your level necessarily. But at Anatoly Karpov's level, this is a fatal error. It's crazy that taking a free pawn and being up one pawn on move 6 at the highest level of the game is fatal. Why is this fatal? You shouldn't have tripled pawns. You especially should not have tripled isolated pawns. No d neighbors, no b neighbors. Everybody needs some d. And so tripled pawns, completely, completely weak for the remainder of the game. Black will play Knight a6, Knight c5. Black will play Queen a5, Black will play knight e4. Black is going to get one of the pawns back. And then White is still left with all the difficulties of having the bad structure. But Mikhail Osipov is three years old. He just saw a free pawn and he took it. Can you blame him? All right. So Knight a6. And in this position, Misha realized, well, I'm not going to be, I probably shouldn't hang on to my pawn, even though moves like Queen d4, moves like Bishop e3 are all enticing. It could do more harm than good, because as you can see, the eval drops even more if you try to defend your pawn. Right? So instead, he plays Bishop g5. Now Bishop g5 is not the most accurate move, but he's developing a Bishop. All right? He's not trying to be greedy. He's developing a Bishop. He's pinning the Knight to the Queen. And life is good. Now here, Karpov just kind of playing the principled move, which is taking the pawn back. And now Karpov will be castling. And he will probably put his Knight on e4. And like I said, Black has regained the pawn and he still has the benefits of the position. What does Black not have? Certain dark square assets, right? This Bishop could try to get in. Osipov develops his Knight. I mean, he's just developing his pieces like normal. Okay, he's slightly worse. He's playing Anatoly Karpov, arguably one of the greatest positional chess players to ever live. b6. Karpov delaying castling in order to finish his development and play in typical Nimso style in the Nimso Indian. All the way back to this move, c5, Black wants to apply pressure to these pawns by virtue of Knight a5 as well as Bishop a6. And in this game, we're not going to get Knight a5. We have Knight on c5. But Karpov wants to apply some c-file pressure to those pawns. And you kind of see White got the Bishop pair early, but because White captured on c5, White has certain drawbacks, right? So we have b6. And now we have g3. I mean, he's going here. Now, Karpov, a machine, all right? You understand Karpov was developing his Queen side, was going to go b6, Bishop a6. But the second that little Osipov played g3, trying to develop his Bishop to g2, Anatoly did not play Bishop a6, trying to win this pawn. Anatoly played h6. Why did he play h6 now? Because if he had played h6 in this position, the Bishop would have gone here, and g5, the Bishop can just escape, and there's nothing. The second the youngster played this to finish up his development, now Anatoly went here, because now he ain't got this. He ain't pinning nothing, because I'm trapping your Bishop. One subtle pawn move, and world champion plays h6. Now, Misha's young. He sees his Bishop is hanging. He probably saw Bishop h4, g5, so he said, I'm going to take. But now, remember, White's entire advantage of this position, the only thing that White could cling on to was the Bishop pair, he no longer has it. However, the position is still materially equal. For a kid this age, this is ridiculous. Now he just plays knight d4. Why did he play knight d4, not Bishop g2? He saw this was hanging. And that's really tough to protect. You could play rook c1, but then your rook is kind of passive, queen d2, there's a fork. He probably thought knight d4, I'm going to go here, and I'm going to attack his rook. Unfortunately, Mr. Karpov was a little bit faster here, but Misha played the best move, f3, not afraid of weakening his position. He's going to go here, here, and castle. Karpov castles. Osiapov plays bishop to g2, finishing up his development, and now that Anatoly has sort of finished the opening stage, it's time to start taking over the position, utilizing the advantages that he got from the opening stage, and he plays bishop a6, right? So this pawn's going to be very tough to defend. If you play knight b5, you stop the attack on this, but I got news for you. Unfortunately, you exacerbate matters, and now it's going to get real bad. And here, Osiapov plays one of the best—he plays f4. Plays pawn to f4, counterattacking the rook. He's three, damn it! Do you—you know how few of you would see f4? Like, I don't know, 200,000 of you? This dude is three years old. It was a matter of weeks ago, he might have not been able to use the potty on his own. He might still not—I don't know when kids are—get potty trained. I don't have one, I have a dog. He's barely potty trained, all right? He's potty trained, I don't know why I'm throwing him under the bus. He's great, he's wonderful. He was awful the first six months, but now he's wonderful. I'm sorry, Benji, you're great. Can you get me a pet food sponsorship? Yo, pet food companies, hit me up. Don't spend money on those Super Bowl ads, they're like 30 million, I'll do it for half. Rook c8, castles, bishop c4. Now here, there is a funny moment. Folks, remember how I told you that it was 10 minutes versus two? Well, here it's about a minute each. Mishra was playing a little slowly, because he's three. So Karpov here says, well, you know, you and I are even on time, and even in the position. Do you want to draw? And Oshipov looks at him and goes, not understanding that he's probably going to lose on time. And, well, unfortunately, he strikes at the world champ. The world champ doesn't allow any activity here, doesn't allow any of this stuff. He closes down the position, and in just a couple of moves, he secures a clamp on the center, everything is defended, pressure on the position. And here, unfortunately, Mishra, Oshipov lost on time. Now, it was sad. It was definitely a little bit sad to see. He was very teary-eyed. He cried a little bit. He was very overwhelmed by the moment. And by the way, that's a separate discussion, bringing a three-year-old on a television program. But he was very overwhelmed, and he ran to his mom, his mom comforted him. But then, I mean, Anatoly was so, so complimenting. He was saying, I've never played somebody this young, his understanding is that of a mature sportsman. It was beautiful, incredible. I highly encourage you to watch it, especially because it's subtitled. Then they brought him back, they gave him a medal, and it was amazing. It was, well, I'll show you. So after they played, Mishra was a bit upset. He was a bit overwhelmed by the moment with the crowd and everything, and he got a bit teary-eyed, and he ran to his mom. It was a very, very sweet moment, and reminding us that he is literally three years old, which is just so mind-blowing. And then what they did is they awarded him a medal, and they invited him to solve puzzles on the monitor. So it's tiny Mishra, Anatoly Karpov and the show host, and Mishra is just solving tactics on a big screen. He's solving tactics. I mean, look at this. This is crazy. He's solving checkmates in three, which I will show you. I'm going to show them to you separately. And at some point, the host, he solves another one, and Mishra, I have no words. At some point, the host asks Anatoly, is this impressive for a three-year-old? And Anatoly's like unbelievably impressive, like so impressive. He is solving some absurd chess studies, like impossible positions that can arise when they are made, like somebody creates the position because the solution is so beautiful and sophisticated. And this three-year-old boy is solving them. I mean, it's just unbelievable stuff. So I just wanted to show you this. I would have showed you the clip, but I can't or else they'll not allow me to monetize the video or even upload it. So enjoy the footage of him solving these positions. This little man solved this position. It's made in three. I mean, you try to solve it. Pause here if you want. Pause the video. Try to solve this checkmate in three. This three-year-old solved checkmate in three. Three. He said Knight h6, because Queen g7 is Knight takes. Here, that's not mate. You hunt the king out, and now the king is cut off geometrically. Knight f5 prevents. But how? Okay, he's good, but can he solve a study? This is a study. This is not a real practical position. It's white to move, do something super creative and win the game. Knight g5, okay. Double g5. This dude said this answer before it even appeared on the screen. Rook f6, rook d6 mate. A king and a rook mate in reverse in the middle of a... I mean, come on, this is ridiculous. And so the producer asked Karpov, he's like, is it actually quite difficult to solve this when you're three? It's quite difficult to solve this if you're 45. And the last one, I mean, was absurd. So it's white to move, checkmate in three. You actually try to solve this. White to move, checkmate in three. First of all, this position is not legal because there's no way it can be white to move unless the king was just on that square or something. Because that's, you know, and white gave a check and black didn't take the knight. This is so sick, this one. And he solved it. Bishop f6, and now the pawn has to take the bishop. The pawn didn't have a legal move. Now there's this king f8, it's stalemate, but the pawn moves. Get out of here. I mean, this is just... Now because this was a few years ago, so Mishra Osipov is like, I don't know, nine or 10 now. Hopefully he's still playing. What sometimes happens is when a kid, when anybody has so much hype behind them, they very, very, they don't live up to it sometimes. You know, LeBron James is probably the greatest example of somebody who has avoided trouble and lived up to the hype, right? Like in terms of, it's what a lot of people say. I can't speak about football, I don't know about football prospects. But it's just incredible. So I really hope he turns into quite a good player and these kind of like early media runs don't totally take away from his confidence or, you know, make him starstruck. And I've known kids, like I used to teach at schools. If anybody's still here watching, I used to teach, before I was a YouTuber, I taught at schools. I ran my own chess program. And the scariest thing for me was rushing a young kid into big things. Like I taught a few four and five year olds that were exceptional students. They were great. They loved chess, natural curiosity. It was amazing watching their brain connect neurons and fire them and learn new things. But the second they went to competition, that was it. They couldn't handle it. The stress, the pressure, all this stuff. So I wish him all the best. And I want to cover, you know, some more young prodigies on this channel, because learning chess and being this good at it at three is an unbelievable feat of the human mind. Really, I mean, exceptional stuff. I'm glad I could share Mikhail Osipov with all of you. And I wish you all have a great rest of your day or evening. Get out of here.",
  "87EJWO_GTo4": "Probably one of the most common questions I see crop up in various Diablo and even just general action RPG communities is which Diablo to start with, and of course I answer the D&D version because you know it's the best thing ever. Though, jokes aside, while the D&D version is interesting in a few rights, most people are looking for which video game to start with, so today we're going to look at where you should start to get the most enjoyment out of your time, since each game does have a reason to start there. Now that said, it would be easy for me to just say which one is my favorite, but that's not very helpful, since different people want different things from games, and they come into it with different experiences. All that combined with the fact that Diablo 4 will be releasing soon adds another common question of whether you should play through the previous games for the lore, or just get a feel for the genre. Thankfully for that last one, with at least the first three games, each title does a fairly good job of being able to stand on its own in regard to story and worldbuilding, and while playing previous games or even reading the books will provide you with additional context, it's not going to hurt your experience to not have heard every lore book in Diablo 1, or listened to every gossip and quest log in Diablo 2, or even found every lore blurb on the ground in Diablo 3 or Immortal. But if you do want to explore the world in order and find all that lore throughout, while the release order is Diablo 1, 2, 3, then Immortal, it is important to remember that Immortal actually occurs between 2 and 3, and a lot of lore is placed for just mcguffins for power changes with each instance of the game. Though in the end it does generally come down to a but wait, there's more type deal game to game as far as the story is concerned. Now as far as the importance in lore, Diablo 1 mostly just establishes some rudimentary basics of the world and injects it with a number of lore books scattered throughout the dungeons, so it's not going to give you an extensive knowledge of the game or the world, but it will introduce you to how the new conflict started. And interestingly enough, it is one situation where the PlayStation version may be more digestible for you, at least lore-wise, since it allows you to listen to the world lore from a menu rather than just happening to stumble upon it like in the PC version. Though admittedly, hard copies of the PlayStation version are getting pretty pricey, while the PC version is just $10 on GOG and comes with the non-canon expansion Hellfire. For Diablo 2, despite having more dialogue, it is even more lore-lite in terms of the world as a whole, but it covers a more modern arc that starts after the events of Diablo 1, with the player characters from the original game actually having lore presence here as well, which you can dig up information about through the gossip of the NPCs and various acts. Most of the lore here though is much more immediate to the game rather than the world as a whole, at least compared to the other entries. Though Diablo 2 and Diablo 3 also saw an increase in external lore sources like physical books, serving to tell the world stories that happen outside the scope of the games. With Diablo 2's lore sticking primarily with the formula of this happened back then and this is how we are impacted now, as opposed to the actual historical books and diaries like we found in Diablo 1. In Immortal, well, it's mostly fluff. There is a bit of story here, but it's mainly just enough to keep you moving on, and is meant to fill a bit of a gap between Diablo 2 and Diablo 3, as we mentioned. But it is by far the least productive whenever it comes to building actual structure in the world, almost entirely focused on immediacy of the next quest or objective to keep you playing. Now for Diablo 3, it does some things better and some things worse. The overall story arc is often dismissed for being weaker than the other mainline games, and to an extent I would agree, but it also includes a lot more personal and journal-style lore of iconic figures in the world to help you understand more about what's going on. And like the previous entries, it is voice acted to help it out as well. The main catch for Diablo 3 is it does lean even heavier into the MacGuffin-itis for the main story, so it will often feel a bit more stilted than the other titles, despite technically having more information available. The only one that is worse about this is, as mentioned, Immortal. Overall, if you're just interested in a quick rundown of the story, various lore channels can be found fine for just getting that, but if you want to experience it first-hand, starting with Diablo 1 will never be a mistake. And the only one that really has no redeeming value in this regard was Immortal, so I'd say only play it for lore if you're really bored and possibly on a toilet at the time. Now in terms of gameplay, which is a whole different can of worms, all three of the mainline games play quite differently, and there will be people who love one and hate the others. This is because they almost fit into three entirely different genres. Diablo 1 is the most methodical and takes far more inspiration from its horror roots and the fact that it was originally going to be turn-based, much like the original Rogue, to help kind of understand this aspect. For more fast-paced players who want more arcade-style games, it will be frustrating and it will feel sluggish at best. For people who come from genres like CRPGs or proper turn-based roguelikes, it will feel much more familiar and have the weight and intent you're looking for. Diablo 3 is the exact opposite.",
  "ylpAHvPlafc": "Many of us like to play live games of chess, but in this video I'm going to teach you how to analyze and learn from the games that you've already played. It doesn't matter whether the game was a win-loss or a draw or how the game made you feel, you must go back and make sure you don't make the same mistakes two times and hopefully not three times. So focus on the thought process. We're gonna take the game phase by phase. The opening stage, where did you leave your opening knowledge, how you navigated the middle game, maybe the end game, and other things like how did you manage your time. Also, we will try to conceptualize into words moves that computers suggest. Okay, so with that said, three people are going to be featured in this video. The first of which is my girlfriend, Lucy. She volunteered to be in this video. Now, when you first turn on any sort of analysis, could be chess.com, whatever it might be, it'll show you this big fancy thing. That thing is nice, but it is more important to analyze with computer, and you'll see I have that in the bottom right hand side. Let's go with the very first game. So Lucy begins with e4. Her opponent plays e5, all standard, and she plays the Vienna. So far so good. Knight to f6. Now, at this point, Vienna's system with Bishop c4 is absolutely possible, but I always recommend that against knight to f6, you play the move f4. So this is kind of a thing you go back and you go, oh, okay, when the knight goes here, I've got to play f4. That takes me into my Vienna gambit. Nothing wrong with this move, and now d6. And the computer at this point, I will say this, you need to not rely so heavily on the computer in the opening phase, because the computer doesn't fully understand openings. It doesn't have an openings database program to the highest extent. So the computer might say, okay, d6 is excellent, but it's actually not a great setup because black has blocked out their bishop, even if the computer says that it's fine. d3, bishop g4, attacking the queen. Computer wants some bishop e6. Doesn't matter. It's the opening stage of the game. It's not such a big deal. So white plays f3. I'm not crazy about the move f3. I don't think it's necessary. I think white can just go here and then castle. But of course, going f3 and attacking the bishop right away isn't a problem, because in the Vienna, we want to play the move knight to e2 regardless. But okay, now white has a like plus.8 advantage, which means close to about a pawn up. We get pawn to h6, white castles, and of course, I mean black should go here and castle. But here black plays the move g5, and the computer is saying, okay, g5 is good, but you'll notice that the evaluation has jumped to plus 1.5, right? So computer's a little bit weird like that. I mean g5 is not a great move. This is not a great move. Black is weakening their own kingside and not developing any pieces, but spending a lot of time actually. Look at the time usage for black. 13 minutes. This is a 15 minute game. So now here white should look to break out in the center because white is developed, or white should just continue with developing another piece. Lucy plays the move knight d5. There's nothing inherently wrong with trading knights here like this, but your bishop's gonna get kicked out, and that's exactly what happened in the game. Now of course here, the two squares that the bishop could go to, it's better to go back to b3. Why? Because if you go back to c4, which is what happens in the game, it's still considered excellent, but it allows black to play the move d5, which attacks your bishop once again, right? You wouldn't have had to deal with that if the bishop just went back here, but because the bishop goes to c4, it allows black to play d5 and have two pawns in the center. Now, Lucy plays bishop b5 check, and you'll notice the computer hasn't at any moment said any of these moves were bad, but the evaluation is back to 0 0 0. It means the position is equalized. If you actually use the engine lines here, what does it say? Well, it actually says that, you know, bishop, that this position, bishop to b3, is a considerably better move than bishop back to c4, right? It's a bishop b3, so you need a combination of the two, okay? Bishop b5 check, black goes knight to d7, which is considered an inaccuracy. It was better to play a little bit more actively. So knight d7, and here knight to g3, attacking the bishop on h5. The bishop slides out of danger. Now, apparently somehow now black has a slight advantage on this computer, but the bar is saying this, which is why analyzing games can be tricky. You need to absorb things that are practical, right? So for example, this move, c4, and you'll notice that all of a sudden black has a big advantage. Why? The move c4 doesn't look like a mistake. The move c4 is an incorrect decision of pawn structure, is what it is. Instead of c4, look at what was recommended. Bishop to e3, just developing the bishop, stopping black from playing this check, right, which can hit the king and the bishop on c4, just developing another piece. And actually, you're not really worried about something like pawn to d4 attacking your bishop, because the bishop just slides out of danger. But the general thing here is, just finish your development. Just finish the development. You haven't moved the bishop yet, just move it in the middle. And c4 is not a great move, because black can kind of close the structure, leave this bishop out. But it's not some sort of horrible mistake, even if the computer is saying that it's a question mark. For a 1000 level game, that's not a bad move at all. So we get a6 attacking the bishop, a trade, another trade, and white plays bishop to e3. You say, how is bishop e3 the best move? This is hanging. Well, actually, taking there is a mistake. Look, queen b5 was played in the game, but the computer is suggesting that you finish developing 2 to hit this bishop, trade, check, and castle. The computer is actually not suggesting to take this pawn. So in the game, we got queen b5, which attacks the b2 pawn, and this, right? Oh, sorry, and this. So this is a fork. Now in the game, Lucy realized that this pawn is hanging, and she's not really worried about losing the b2 pawn. She'd rather open up the position. And d4 is considered an inaccuracy. And look at what it's saying. It's saying rook c1 is the best move. The computer wants rook c1, hanging both pawns. Now, how do you verbalize that? Like, why would the engine want this? There's, I mean, for a beginner, there's no easy way to verbalize that. I mean, why is rook c1 the best move, according to the computer? It basically, the point is that you can sacrifice a pawn here for activating your rook. That's the point. Black is spending time taking the pawn. You can activate your rook. But for what? You don't see the immediate gain of rook to c1. So you can't really fault a move like d4. For this level, this is a great move. Why? Because the position now begins to open. Black takes on b2, which is a mistake. Look at what the engine wants. The engine instead wanted long castle. It wants long castle. It wants to castle the king into all this open space. I mean, that's just so impractical, right? Queen takes b2, pawn takes e5, and now queen takes e5 is a losing mistake. And you know what the craziest thing is? It's not a losing mistake because of this move. This move looks like it wins. Because what happens if you play this is you pin the queen to the rook, and you're winning. But here, apparently, look at the bar. Black can play bishop c5, and you cannot take the queen because your bishop is pinned to your own king. Just absolute craziness, right? The best move, and Lucy actually found it, it got called a brilliant move. Rook to e1. It got the legendary double exclamation mark on Chess.com. Why? Because you stay patient for one move. You stay patient. The queen is lined up to the king. So any bishop move is going to be a hit on the king, and by staying patient, black cannot stop both threats. If you play bishop c5 now, then I just take the bishop, and you can't take back because you're pinned and you're going to lose. So by staying patient for one move, white got this brilliant move. It's actually funny. I spoke to Lucy about this, and we were discussing this move, bishop d4, but she was like, well, I saw rook to e1 and then this, and this was my whole idea. And I was like, it's funny how that works, because the computer, if you played this in a game, would have said bishop d4 was a mistake, even if the game would have ended with you winning a rook. The computer would have said bishop d4 is a bad move because of this crazy defense. But you need to understand that for your level of chess, whatever it is that you are, just because a 3000 level cyborg says it wasn't good, look, white is playing great so far this game, right? Both players made the mistake this game of not developing fast enough. Black never developed. And after rook e1, black's in serious trouble. Black plays rook c8, bishop d4, and is just losing a queen, right? Like straight up just losing a queen, has to sacrifice. It's now a check, and the rook is hanging. So now it all falls apart. But there's one funny moment of this game, which is why computers are so terrible. Rook c6, now how do you win this with white, with the extra queen? You bring the rook, fantastic move, trying to trade. Rook jumps into c8, bishop d8 is a blunder, right? Two question mark blunder. But what does that even mean? I mean, black is down a queen. Like, how can you, like, you know, look at what the computer says. It's like, oh, it's plus 10. Oh, but this move blunders mate. But that's why, like, analyzing endgames with computers is stupid, because you have an extra queen. I mean, like, who cares if the game is over? You know, like, the best move the computer wanted was to move the king and attack the rook. Now, this is really funny. This last one cracks me up. Queen d1, threatening mate, which looks unstoppable, and black resigns, is considered an inaccuracy. The move which won white the game and forced the resignation is an inaccuracy. Why? Because the only way to stop mate here is to play rook to e1 check, hitting both the king and the queen, okay? If the queen takes the rook, the king now escapes, and you'll mate in apparently seven or eight moves if you play the best. However, if you had played queen to d2, then this check wouldn't hit the queen, and your best move, according to the computer, is to move the king, to keep the queen lined up to this bishop, to not take the free rook, and to go here, because mathematically speaking, you're going to take the bishop. This is why I'm showing this video, because some things you can take from computers and try to understand, but other things you simply cannot. You simply cannot, right? Like, okay, I mean, like, white played a great game. White played a great game. What did white do wrong? Well, in the opening, white didn't go for the Vienna Gambit. So next time we go for the Vienna Gambit, what did black do? What did black do? They played this kind of strange move, and then black just played too aggressively. Did white have to trade knights? No. But this was a fantastic game, even if the computer gives it, what, 50% score? To me, this was a 90% score game, because white blundered nothing. White is a 1000-rated player that didn't make a blunder. I mean, white made a few inaccurate moves, according to the computer. Did white ever blunder? No. And the moment that black blundered, Rookie1 won the game, Bishop d4, boom. Fantastic game, honestly. And I'm not just saying that because she's my girlfriend, and she'd be upset, right? Now we go to this game, okay? So this is a game, uh, kind of pink Jake played. It's a game he played with the black pieces. He's a, he's a 1537-rated player, so a little bit higher, right? But we're still going to use the engine. And notice the accuracy here, right? The accuracy says that Jake played at 36. Jake did not play this game at 36. He didn't win this game, but he definitely didn't play it at 36% score. So let's go through it, okay? Let's use the analysis. Let's go show lines. e4, so Jake plays the Karakan, d4, d5. So far, so good. Knight f3, knight c6, bishop b5. It's one of the moves. This is one of the moves against the exchange Karakan. Black plays bishop d7. All theory so far. Takes, bishop takes, castles, white plays, black plays e6, trying to develop the bishop. Knight develops, bishop pins, bishop d6, right? Now here, you know, one argument can be made that you should move the queen out, so you can go for the weak b2 pawn. But after bishop d6, knight e5, and short castle, I'm not criticizing anything that Jake did. He finished all his development, and he castled. However, in these exchange Karakan positions, one thing that you need to realize is this pin can be annoying. And in general, it's better to have the bishop blocking this pin rather than the bishop more active, because that way you can move your knight, right? And what happens in the game is Jake is unable to really move his knight. That's his issue. He plays, white plays knight to g4, which pins and adds pressure, but now Jake just very correctly just slides back defensively, right? Slides back defensively. Say, well, why is the computer saying king to h8? What the hell is this? The computer is saying this is another good move, because if you open up the g file, it's actually not clear who's attacking who. So the computer is suggesting getting the king out of the way, anticipating the damaging of the pawn structure, and using the g file against the opponent. But Be7 is completely fine. We get this, this, and bishop back to f4. Now, why is this a losing mistake? Of course, in the game, you have no idea why it's a losing mistake. We only have computer after. This is a losing mistake because here black can create a threat, a threat that actually white cannot stop. And Re8 gives you this minus sign, which means missed win. What does that mean? That means that you missed a move which would have given you a massive, massive advantage, a winning advantage. So you go back, you go, what did I miss? Oh, I should have played queen b6. Why? Oh, because I would have been attacking this and this. And if I got my queen in there, now if we follow the best line here, c3, queen takes b2, you'll notice you're hitting everybody, right? It actually doesn't even matter what happens, where white moves, you'll win at least two pawns, and you will have a winning advantage. That is what black missed. You go, oh, okay, that's why queen b6 was the best move. Okay, jake played rook e8, which was slow, white played knight c3, which is again a mistake, and now jake finds this move. For white, why is knight c3 a mistake? It allows queen to b6. So the best move for white is c3 with the pawn strengthening the center, and then if queen to b6, you just defend it with the queen, for example. Queen here, even a queen trade, queen d2, doesn't matter, but you're never losing any of these pawns. That is why knight c3 for white was a mistake, and now jake finds queen to b6. So, so far, 15 moves by jake, he's playing all the best moves. Rook b1, and by the way, you say, rook b1? What? Why is that a mistake? Why, why, where did the e-val go? Why is this so, what? Rook b1 is a bad move because white should be more focused on defending the center pawn. Look at this, what does the computer suggest instead of rook b1? Bishop to e5. It wants white, instead of this, to go here, so that after queen takes b2 now, look at this. Apparently, queen b2 is a losing mistake, because white is going to play this, this, and attack your king. Like, just play rook here, defending the knight. It looks like black has played only natural moves, but suddenly black is losing, because white has opened up the king and is going to get in here with the queen and the knight. Excuse me, the queen and the rook. So, now the best thing is to take first, not open your king, and then go queen takes pawn. So it's all these little details, right? Rook to b1 was played in this game, and black plays bishop takes d4. Now we get bishop back to g3. How does black make progress in this position? Do you bring a rook? Jake pushed in the middle, which apparently gave back advantage. Look what the computer wants, it wants bishop back. The computer just wants you to move your bishop back. How on earth are you supposed to, like, explain that? If you're like a 1400, 1500, like, why does the computer want me to just play a move that looks like it does nothing? Because it wants you to bring the bishop back, and the bishops support the pawns pushing. It does not, the computer does not like that you've left your bishop here, and it could be a target. And white immediately plays the best move, targeting the bishop. White down a pawn wants to trade your powerful bishop. That is why this is considered a bad move. Go back with the bishop first, anticipate that your piece can be a target, and then, and then you push your pawns. And now white finds again the best move, b4, a fantastic move. The point is that you cannot take, and Jake didn't take, you cannot take because you pin yourself. And by pinning yourself, white now plays c3 and wins the bishop. Great move by white, and that forces black to go back to d6. Now white finds another excellent move, utilizing this pin. So basically your bishop, by not retreating a few moves ago, doesn't have a home anymore, and is stranded in the line of sight of all the other pieces. c4, another beautiful pawn move by white. You cannot take, you cannot take this. But what's the threat? There's a few threats with this move. Number one, it's to take you, because you're protected. So you can't take. Why can't you push? You can't push because c5, c5 is another threat. Whoops, c5 is another threat. So there's too many threats here. Push the pawn and take, you can't stop both. But look at what the computer wants. It wants queen c7. Why does it want that move? Doesn't that just lose a pawn? Yeah, but the computer is trying to argue that even though you lose your pawn, you're still plus two of advantage. Black has nearly two points worth of advantage. It doesn't feel that way. You just lost a pawn. Material is equal. How do I have two points of advantage? Well, yeah, I mean, it thinks that you have more space. It likes control of the c-file. It likes the bishop, and it thinks that white's pieces are not active enough. But that's why it's so tricky to analyze with computer. In the game, Jake played rook d8, and we know that is obviously a bigger mistake because after rook to d8, c5. And after c5, of course, what does Jake do here? Well, he's forked, so what should he do? He should take. He should play bishop takes, pawn takes, and queen takes. He should play bishop takes, pawn takes, and queen takes to get two pawns. But he goes here, which is a big mistake. It's a big mistake because after take, take, look at that. Look at that, by the way. Do you see that? Taking back is a mistake. The best move, according to the computer, is to push the pawn. I mean, what? Do you know why that's the best move? Because the computer is arguing the d-pawn that you're trying to capture is not going anywhere, and it's more important to negate the movement of the white knight, which is so easy to understand if I sit here explaining it to you. But how on earth are you supposed to know not to take a pawn to just create this barrier so that white can't move the knight? I mean, it's all about anticipating what the opponent wants, but this is a mistake, a much more obvious mistake, because of course you need to take this and get two pawns, not one, right? So that's a little bit more practical. Queen c4 is good, but the problem is that knight c3 comes with an attack on the queen and this. That is the problem. If you had anticipated knight c3, you would have went, uh-oh, that's really bad. And after queen c4, black... There's bishop takes e5, which is the wrong move. Bishop takes e5 is actually the wrong move. White should have played, according to the computer, a move like rook takes e5. Okay, why rook takes e5? Well, it creates a threat on your rook, right? If I take your knight, which looks free, then you take, I take, and you take my rook, and you are completely winning. So if we go back a little bit, why is bishop takes e5 wrong? Well, this bishop is guarding the knight, so if you play rook takes, that's the best move. You get the bishop, and then you get the knight, and there's no mate. This is not mate because the bishop is covering. It is better in chances where you can get two pieces for a rook to see that you could get two pieces for a rook. So that is much more understandable as a concept. But Jake plays this move, which I don't like so much, but then f4 happens. Why is f4 such a blunder? f4 is such a blunder. f6 looks like the best move. This looks like the best move, which is what Jake played. Now, if the bishop moves, you take here, right? But the computer wants you to go d4 because it thinks that this is the best move because this pawn cannot be taken because of the pin. This is really difficult. When the computer is out here spouting lines at you and telling you, this was good, this was not good, it's really hard. I like f6 because the computer says, what, b5? I mean, come on, that didn't happen. That didn't happen, queen b3 happened, and now, I mean, you're about to win this, right? So of course you should trade. You have to win this bishop. You have to trade the queen. Take the queen, take the bishop, don't ask any questions. But Jake goes here, and that leaves the queen as a target. This is a much more understandable mistake. The bishop is hanging. What's worth more than a bishop? The queen. I'm going to chase the queen down. You just gave me a target. A lot of this is anticipating how our piece can be put under attack. You notice that throughout this game, it's, can they attack my piece? Be simple. Take the queen, take the bishop. But in the game, what happens? One mistake, and now we're still losing this bishop, but we have one, two, three. 3 and white shatters our defenses. Finally, we take this back, but it's too late. Now the knight is here, and the knight gets to c7, and the game is over, because both of our rooks are under attack. King h8, they pick up the rook, we take back, rook d8 check, and that's it. I mean, we just can't defend ourselves fast enough. We go back, and white plays queen a4, excellent move. Putting pressure on this pin, right? We have to go back, and the final domino falls, and white wins with the move, rook takes e5, and black resigns. And black resigns, because after take-take, you cannot prevent this bishop from being taken, and the game is simply over. All of this is so difficult to conceptualize into terms, but you can, and we did. That's actually one thing that you have to realize, like, we did. As the game was going on, we were saying, well, I have to create more threatening moves. Exactly, I created a more threatening move. White defended the wrong pawn, and rather than me pushing my pawns blindly, I need to make sure my pieces are not targets. If I want to go e5, can white go here with the knight? Oh, that looks a little unpleasant, right? Backwards knight moves. And what did we learn? c4? There's multiple threats associated with the move. Be careful, there is a fork. Bring it back, lose the pawn, and then regroup. Also, if you blunder something like this, two pawns for the piece, two pawns for the piece rather than one. This is not a practical blunder, but here, right here, keep it simple. Take the queen, take the bishop, don't ask any questions. Queen d3 is too much, right? And immediately our queen became a target, and the position fell apart. So, a lot to learn from a game like this. The opening was good, a lot of middle game concepts here, a lot of piece dynamics and interactions. And now, we will end the video with an extremely impressive game. A game by one of my subscribers rated 1900 Blitz, but 2300 10-minute rapid chess. Excellent player, he's given me trouble in the past before. His name is Razorlike. And perhaps the thing that Razorlike should be more proud of here, most proud of, is look at this evaluation. No inaccuracies, no mistakes, no blunders. The opponent made one inaccuracy, playing at 83%. So, let's see how Razorlike won a really, really nice game. And look at that, he gets one word, smooth. Look at this, smooth. Doesn't matter, by the way, you can still analyze games like this. So, first stage of the game. Vienna. Oh, no, sorry, sorry, Karl Kahn, Karl Kahn. e5, something that he knows from book. Bishop f5. Here he plays the tile variation, something that I've recommended for him. h6, you know that against h6, you play g4. And the idea, if black goes back to h7, is the move e6, sacrificing a pawn to go here. And basically, if the bishops are traded, the light squares near the king are a problem. So far, all book. You know this all because you've studied the opening. Black plays knight f6, white takes on h7, black takes with the knight. And around here, you're basically on your own. And Razorlike plays the move g5, which is a great move. Why? Because if take, take, you've opened up the rook to pin the knight to the rook, which is horrible. Plus, you are threatening this whenever you want it. Black has already messed up. So black plays queen d6 with a long-term plan of moving the knight and castling. So what does Razorlike do? He says, uh-uh, queen h5 check. Now you're never castling. Now your knight is stuck in the center of the board. And now he begins operation two, transition of opening to middle game. Where are my opponent's pawn breaks? How is my opponent going to get out of this bind? Where are the pawn breaks? f4 and e5, uh, sorry, c5 and e5. I spoiled the move. He plays f4, an excellent move, controlling the central pawn break. And next you will play knight to f3. Black plays the right pawn break, c5, but white plays knight f3, the best move. Knight f3 is an excellent move. Uh, and again, you'll notice that c5 is a mistake because of knight f3. Apparently the best move for black there was what? Was what? Was what? The best move for black is g6? What if I take? And then black, look, look at the computer. Computer wants to sacrifice a pawn and play e5. The computer wants to sacrifice a pawn and trade queens because it thinks that white's queen is so powerful. I mean, that's insane. That is just a ridiculous engine move. Black is playing like a human. Look at this move, knight e5, threatening knight f7 and knight g6, forcing black to do this. And now look at this. Look at what white does here, d e5, which is the best move because you remove your pawn from the sites of this pawn. You create an impenetrable structure. The bishop cannot enter. The knight cannot move. Queen goes to c6. Uh-oh. This knight is stuck. Knight f6, oh, sorry, d4, great move. Counterattacking, so we're not just rushing to take. And razor-like is just a boss. He castles. Razor-like castles himself out of danger, and black has to sacrifice the knight. Now, in the next phase of the game, white is trying to transition from being up material to actually winning this position. Because you are up a piece, you have to bring the piece into the game. But because black has all eight pawns, you'll need to crack at the position with your pawns. So watch what white does. Knight to d2, solid developing move, bishop d6, and the knight jumps to c4, hitting the bishop. The bishop slides out of danger. And what does white do? Well, I want my knight to live here forever. I anticipate my opponent will kick my knight out. I'm going to play a4. If now my opponent plays b5, I just take. So opponent plays king d7. White plays b3. Not the best move. I don't think I would have played b3 even if the computer says it. I mean, I like it. It's a decent move. Maybe you get your bishop out. I probably would have slid my rook over to target this pawn or bring my queen back or go for a queen trade. We're up material. You might as well go for a queen trade, right? So b3, and now rook a to e8. Now white plays bishop d2, which is the best move. Black plays rook to e7. Rook to e7 is a great move. White plays rook to e1, and black plays rook to e8. So all the pieces have now joined the party. So what do we do? All the pieces are here. Black has eight pawns. What do we do? c3. I told you, at a certain moment, you have to break. And that's exactly what happens. Black plays e5, and white just goes... chops everything down. Bam, bam, bam, bam, queen g4 check. Another really good move, bringing the queen closer via a check. King to d8, bishop to b4. You're falling apart from both sides. All it took was a pawn break in a closed position. After rook e6, white defends the pawn from the rook. Black plays e4. But now, but now, there are some weaknesses. And white plays rook c1, creating a threat on the queen. If the knight moves to d6, the bishop is protecting it, and the rook hits the queen. So we get queen d5. Rook f5 comes in hitting. The queen slides out of danger. The rook follows. Check. And now, knight d6 check. And the point is that after the knight jumps in, you cannot take. The rooks swarm, and the game is over. So why didn't this game, one, by using a superior base of opening knowledge and immediately punishing the opponent's mistakes, clogging up the position and using a combination of pawn play and piece play to maximize the pressure, anticipating the opponent's moves, one pawn break, and when the opponent responded, there was chop, chop, chop, chop, bam. Great game, huh? Good game to end on. Even games like that, you have to analyze. But I will leave you with a bonus lesson. This position was sent to me by a viewer, and they asked me, in this position, in this game, you cannot take the queen because you are pinned. They played the move bishop takes b4. And their logic was the opponent cannot take back. Why is this a two-question mark blunder? And notice what the computer wanted instead. The computer instead wants queen takes b4. And the person was like, why is that the best move? If take here, knight c2, this is what you do. If you're ever confused with a computer suggestion, you pull it up. Say, why queen takes b4? Knight takes, I take the queen, they go check, knight c2, oops, sorry, they go check, knight c2, king d2, knight takes a1. Why is this so good for me? I'm down two points of material because the knight is trapped. And if you follow the line, the engine just wants this, this, and take. And once you win the knight, you have two pieces for the rook, which is considered an advantage. That is why queen takes b4 is the top engine move. You say, well, let me, what if check, and then my queen is hanging? Queen e4. You can move your queen out of the danger of the knight into the defense, and it's protected. That is how you learn from engine suggestions. Then you go back, and you try to incorporate it into your own knowledge of the game, and go, is that something I could have seen? Probably not. Sometimes the computer gives you an evaluation that's five moves deep. You have to decide whether or not that is practical for your application of the game. But what you do absolutely have to zone in on with all of this is that, was your opening good? You have to go review your opening line. If it wasn't good, did you get a good position from the opening? How did the opponent play that was different from what you knew? How was your middle game? Did you follow good tactical patterns? Did you implement a good game plan out of your opening, like Razorlike did in that last game, right? The ideas of your opening. And then tying all of these suggestions back to yourself. Oh, I realize here I should have taken the bishop for the two pawns rather than the one pawn. Or here, oh, okay, I see. But sometimes you won't understand. You need to apply the knowledge to your chess that is the most practical. But one thing is for sure, you have to absolutely analyze your games. Thanks for watching.

  "HhSCMGdq11Y": "Hey, we're back with another episode of Before You Buy, that show where we give you some straight up gameplay and our first impressions of the latest games releasing. As usual, it's me Jake, and today we're talking about The Last of Us Part 1, finally released on PC. If you're a PlayStation gamer, this might not seem like a big deal to you. I mean, like, it's the remake we've seen recently on PS5, which is of course a remake of a game we've played remastered on PS4, and then of course there was the original PlayStation 3 version before that, but PC fans have been waiting a long time for this one, and after years and then some delays, it's finally here. So we bought it just yesterday and fired it up to give you some quick first impressions. Usually we get these types of quick look impressions out the night of the day it releases, but we're a day late because we ran into some problems. Yeah, by now you may have heard, The Last of Us on PC is a messy release. If you look at Steam's mostly negative reviews, it's all because of performance issues. There are the occasional PC players out there who have had little problems, you know. Some people have managed to have way better luck than us, but unfortunately we did not fall in that boat. For us right now, it seems like The Last of Us PC isn't really recommended. It needs significant kinks worked out, and if you jump in now without any patches or updates, it's a bit of a gamble whether or not it'll actually run well for you, especially if you're not like a technical wizard. In real time right now, it seems like the community is already working through their own homemade fixes, but like keep in mind, we are not tech whizzes. We can give our impressions as folks who play PC games, but in terms of using community tricks to try and fix it, we don't have any recommendations yet. And frankly, we paid $60, this should work. Usually in these videos, we always recommend and defer to Digital Foundry for their more technical take, but at the time of making this video, they don't have a video up yet. It doesn't seem like early reviews were really a thing for this one. But anyway, in our experience, we had a really hard time getting it stable while easily meeting the recommended specs. I mean, we had a 2080 Super, an up to par processor, and a damn good SSD, and we did not have a good time. Trying to get this game running at like 1440 and close to 60 as we could possibly get meant dropping most settings down to medium and some on low. And even that, no matter what little things we did and what we tried to tweak in settings and our PC here and there, it just didn't amount to anything really good. Plus, no matter what you do, it takes up seemingly an unreasonable amount of VRAM and it left our PC absolutely screaming constantly. I mean, the game looks all right, for sure, but we still had some stuttering and couldn't get a consistent frame rate. This was even with taking advantage of DLSS and messing with everything, we just couldn't get a smooth experience. I've seen others get better frame rates, some with higher specs, but often still not at great resolutions. And again, not the most consistent. And that lack of consistency here is just the most disappointing thing. And the inconsistency, like with the stuttering and the frame rate problems and stuff, like visually, yes, it's not good to look at, it hurts the experience, but also just kind of affects how you play the game a little bit. Like at this point, we all pretty much know The Last of Us pretty well here, and we can usually smoke a lot of sections, but like, it just doesn't feel right because the game is all stuttery. And that's what really feels like has been hurting the most for us. But anyway, even though it's the remake, which looks graphically great, it looked great on PlayStation 5, this is still a game that PC players have been waiting to play since the PS3 days. And it has been micro stutter city over here. Reports of crashes are widespread, but for us, after a few hours of play, we only experienced like one. It does, however, have some weird hangups where the game just freaks out for a second or flashes. And we have seen some pretty funny glitches being passed around online. With us, nothing that crazy, but just, we just couldn't get a solid experience out of it. And along with that, we just kept finding all kinds of weird choices and issues. Like The Last of Us always had a film grainy look, but here, for some reason, it's turned up to like 11, which is really like a weird default choice. And it made the game look so much worse. We turned that down immediately. And along with that, the load times are really long, like really long, like something is wrong, like despite our good hardware. And speaking of long, a significant issue we've had and we've seen reported by some other folks, compiling shaders. Now compiling shaders before firing up the game is great. It's a welcome feature, love to see it. Dead Space Remake did it, if you played that, you might remember that. We'll always wait for those guys to build, but something is wrong here. We sat watching that percentage meter for like well over an hour. Yes, serious, look up online and you'll find plenty of other people having the same or longer times. I've seen almost like two and a half hours for some people. And some people have had crashes in between all this. There's reports of memory leaks, basically anything you name it, it seems like there's an issue that's affecting someone. So what is going on? What happened here? We're not the only YouTube channel or website to point out that PC ports have been getting extra half-assed treatment lately, but this one just hurts even more. It's a game, you know, some people that I know, real absolute freaks that have been waiting for a PC version for forever and have managed to avoid spoilers of this game. It's also Sony's golden goose. I mean, it's The Last of Us, man. So how it got this kind of inconsistent treatment is beyond me. It had been delayed, as you probably remember, in their words, quote unquote, to make sure The Last of Us PC debut is in the best shape possible. And for seemingly for the majority of users, that hasn't ended up being the case. Why rush it out? Why half cook it? Especially considering Last of Us had a resurgence of popularity since the HBO show and everything that really popped off with mainstream audiences. Like they're releasing the game at the best possible time, but it seems like maybe they rushed it out. What's even more strange is that it is almost there. Like it has a good amount of options and supporting different setups. So in theory, it's a fully featured PC version that people would want. You know, the display options are pretty in depth. The graphical options are pretty staggering. Like you have a lot of control over every individual thing and the game menus are nicely detailed and show you what graphical feature has what effect on particular parts of your PC. It's all just broken down really nicely. And yet the game itself is tricky to run. Like it just seems poorly optimized and it's a huge shame. And then of course, like some people are going to ask, there's the Steam Deck. Okay, so get this. I was waiting for it to like load up on Steam Deck so I could give you guys a little offscreen demo of it not performing too well, but it like loaded for five minutes and then it hard crashed and it just rebooted. Oh God. Like the whole thing was bricked. It's finally back on. Thank God. But I don't know if I want to do that again. Okay, here we are trying again. Oh, oh, oh dude. Totally crashed again. I've seen other people get it like kind of running, but like this is well so much for this one. And I mean all of this is a shame because people who can't get it to run or, you know, end up deciding to wait before buying are just missing out on an otherwise great game. At this point, you've heard from us a bunch of times by now. Sure. Especially with the most recent PS5 remake. Sorry if I repeat myself, but The Last of Us Part One is a solid update of the original classic. It's the best way to play it. It looks and plays great in a perfect situation. It's a good package of a game in theory. You know, this remade version has better controls, more features, the cool weapon desk system, from part two, you're getting multiple difficulty modes, the ability to replay with different skins and cool cheats enabled and stuff like the add-on expansion left behind, which is the whole extra little bit of playable content that dives more into Ellie. Now sure, like the classic multiplayer factions isn't here from the original game, but it's still just a really good amount of stuff to play through. The PlayStation 5 Last of Us Part One is like the definitive version of the game. You know, whether or not you wanted to pay $70 for it and here on PC, this could have also been the definitive version of the game, but it's just not quite there yet. You know, I could spend a ton of time waxing nostalgic on the game and the story and everything, but most of you have probably experienced it or at least heard it from someone by now. It's a solid one. It's filled with memorable moments, scary, gory stuff, heartbreaking characters, grim reality, moments of beauty and wonder, you strangle dudes while looking them in the eye, you blow up creatures and you journey across a post-apocalyptic United States hitting people with bricks. There's just not many games like this in the world of games and, you know, PC fans could have really been experiencing something really good here and I think ultimately they will at some point. We've seen a lot of releases get cleaned up, but that's not excusing the fact that they put it out right now and they're asking for your money and you're getting something that there is a very good chance that it's not going to run well on your machine. Like I said, the community is probably going to figure out fixes before the developers even do, but this also gets in the way of the stuff I want to see. I want to see people really play the hell out of this game on insane, awesome settings. I want to see the community mod this and just do weird stuff. I want to see CJ from San Andreas and like Kermit the Frog as Joel and Ellie or some shit. I don't know how the PC community is like that stuff is so great, but these issues are getting in the way of what could have been just like a really fun, cool launch of a classic and honestly beloved game. It seemed like it was an easy win, but unfortunately it's just not there yet. We're just one account. We only tested this on our machine, so I do want to point out for people, do your research if you're still thinking about buying in on this, make sure you know what's up. Definitely read a couple of reviews. Obviously the steam reviews are popping off, but just like, you know, pick some other people, pick some other opinions because as of right now for us, we vote to wait on this one. Here's hoping they fix it soon, but that's a before you buy. You know how this goes by now. Just some quick first impressions. We give you some pros, some cons and some personal opinion, and now we want to hear yours. Did you jump in? How has your experience been? I know there are some people out there that haven't had issues, so if that's the case, hope you're liking the game so far. But if there are other people out there with issues, were you able to fix it in some way? Were you not? Did you get a refund? Let's talk about anything the last of us PC down in the comments. Is this video helped you out? Maybe gave you a heads up or something like that. All you got to do is click the like button. It legitimately helps us. So thank you. But we're putting out videos every day. So thank you guys very much for watching. We'll see in the next one.",
  "to78maCxFEs": "So I've spoken with Noam Chomsky, who's been kind of one of the many people that are critical of large language models being able to achieve general intelligence, right? And so it's an interesting question that they've been able to achieve so much incredible stuff. Do you think it's possible that large language models really is the way we build AGI? I think it's part of the way. I think we need other super important things. This is philosophizing a little bit. Like what kind of components do you think in a technical sense or a poetic sense does need to have a body that it can experience the world directly? I don't think it needs that. But I wouldn't say any of this stuff with certainty, like we're deep into the unknown here. For me, a system that cannot go significantly add to the sum total of scientific knowledge we have access to, kind of discover, invent whatever you wanna call it, new fundamental science is not a super intelligence. And to do that really well, I think we will need to expand on the GPT paradigm in pretty important ways that we're still missing ideas for. But I don't know what those ideas are. We're trying to find them. I could argue sort of the opposite point that you could have deep, big scientific breakthroughs with just the data that GPT is trained on. I think some of it is, like if you prompt it correctly. Look, if an oracle told me far from the future that GPT-10 turned out to be a true AGI somehow, maybe just some very small new ideas, I would be like, okay, I can believe that. Not what I would have expected sitting here. I would have said a new big idea, but I can believe that. This prompting chain, if you extend it very far and then increase at scale the number of those interactions, like what kind of, if these things start getting integrated into human society and it starts building on top of each other, I mean, I don't think we understand what that looks like. Like you said, it's been six days. The thing that I am so excited about with this is not that it's a system that kind of goes off and does its own thing, but that it's this tool that humans are using in this feedback loop. Helpful for us for a bunch of reasons. We get to learn more about trajectories through multiple iterations, but I am excited about a world where AI is an extension of human will and a amplifier of our abilities and this most useful tool yet created. And that is certainly how people are using it. And I mean, just like look at Twitter, like the results are amazing. People's like self-reported happiness with getting to work with this are great. So yeah, like maybe we never build AGI, but we just make humans super great. Still a huge win. Yeah, I said, I'm a part of those people. Like the amount, I derive a lot of happiness from programming together with GPT. Part of it is a little bit of terror of- Can you say more about that? There's a meme I saw today that everybody's freaking out about sort of GPT taking programmer jobs. No, the reality is just, it's going to be taking, like if it's going to take your job, it means you were a shitty programmer. There's some truth to that. Maybe there's some human element that's really fundamental to the creative act, to the act of genius that is in great design that's involved in programming. And maybe I'm just really impressed by all the boilerplate that I don't see as boilerplate, but is actually pretty boilerplate. Yeah, and maybe that you create like, you know, in a day of programming, you have one really important idea. Yeah. And that's the contribution. That would be, and that's the contribution. And there may be, like, I think we're going to find, so I suspect that is happening with great programmers and that GPT-like models are far away from that one thing, even though they're going to automate a lot of other programming. But again, most programmers have some sense of, you know, anxiety about what the future's going to look like, but mostly they're like, this is amazing. I am 10 times more productive. Don't ever take this away from me. There's not a lot of people that use it and say like, turn this off, you know? Yeah, so I think, so to speak to the psychology of terror is more like, this is awesome. This is too awesome, I'm scared. Yeah, there is a little bit of- This coffee tastes too good. You know, when Kasparov lost to Deep Blue, somebody said, and maybe it was him, that chess is over now. If an AI can beat a human at chess, then no one's going to bother to keep playing, right? Because like, what's the purpose of us or whatever? That was 30 years ago, 25 years ago, something like that. I believe that chess has never been more popular than it is right now. And people keep wanting to play and wanting to watch. And by the way, we don't watch two AIs play each other, which would be a far better game in some sense than whatever else. But that's not what we choose to do. Like, we are somehow much more interested in what humans do in this sense. And whether or not Magnus loses to that kid, then what happens when two much, much better AIs play each other? Well, actually, when two AIs play each other, it's not a better game by our definition of better. Because we just can't understand it. No, I think they just draw each other. I think the human flaws, and this might apply across the spectrum here, AIs will make life way better, but we'll still want drama. We will, that's for sure. We'll still want imperfection and flaws, and AI will not have as much of that. Look, I mean, I hate to sound like utopic tech bro here, but if you'll excuse me for three seconds, like the level of the increase in quality of life that AI can deliver is extraordinary. We can make the world amazing, and we can make people's lives amazing. We can cure diseases. We can increase material wealth. We can help people be happier, more fulfilled, all of these sorts of things. And then people are like, oh, well, no one is gonna work. But people want status. People want drama. People want new things. People wanna create. People want to feel useful. People want to do all these things, and we're just gonna find new and different ways to do them, even in a vastly better, unimaginably good standard of living world."
